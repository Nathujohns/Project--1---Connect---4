# Connect 4 Game 


#Connect Four

A two-player connection board game, in which the players choose a color and then take turns dropping colored tokens into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid. The pieces fall straight down, occupying the lowest available space within the column. The objective of the game is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of four of one's own tokens.The first player can always win by playing the right moves.

# The Approach 

- Includes HTML/CSS/Javascript
- Javascript used in making the board and cells



# Post-Project Reflection 

- The area where the game could have developed more is in the hovering function, where when it is the Red's turn or the Yellow's turn to play, it would show the color on top of the columns.
- A score point could have been created as well.
